Flying Frenzy
=======
*Multidisciplinary Game Research - Utrecht University Summer School.*

---------

The project was done under 8-10 hours as a workshop piece for the UU Multidisciplinary Game Research Summer School "Building JavaScript Games" sessions.

The project was built on a simplified version (for example no animation module) of the Powerup.js engine, designed by Arjan Egges.

The project won best game design and implementation at the 2016 UU Multidisciplinary Game Research Summer School home contest, judged by the school and associates of the Dutch Game Garden.
The game awarded first place for the shift development, focused design, and good lean project management practise.
